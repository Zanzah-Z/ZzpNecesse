# ZzpNecesse
Overhaul for Necesse with custom bat launcher for hosting Dedicated Server

Open .bat with Notepad (or better yet Notepad++) or any text editor and fill out required info, replace [] with actual data, remove the <>s they are just placeholders and won't work with them in the file.
What needs editing:



::Remember to remove all the []'s from each placeholder::



-Xms[minimumRAM]G

::Replace [minimumRAM] with GB allocation for server, i.e. '-Xms12G'


-Xmx[maximumRAM]G

::Replace [maximumRAM] with GB allocation for server, i.e. '-Xmx24G'


-ip [IPaddress]:[PORT]

::Replace [IPaddress] with External IP addres from hosted server or if local; whatsmyip.com, [PORT]> should be 14159 by default.


-world [WORLDNAME]

::Replace [WORLDNAME] with the Save-folder name you want for each world. This will be how it appears in the server browser aswell.


-password [PASSWORD]

::Replace [PASSWORD] with anything you want, i.e. -password TOMKYN


-localdir "[pathtoSTEAM]\steamapps\common\Necesse Dedicated Server\saves\worlds\[<WORLDNAME]"    

::Replace [pathtoSTEAM] with where you installed your Dedicated server

::Replace [WORLDNAME] with the same one as before for continuity.

::NOTE-- You can make this directory anything you want if you would like to save your worldfiles elsewhere.


-motd "[MOTD]"

::Replace [MOTD] (Quotes needed) with your message of the day i.e. "Join our discord: discord.gg/xxxxxxxx"


-owner [ADMINname]

::Replace [ADMINname] with your character name, or it could be your steam name, mine are both the same so if one doesn't work try the other.


-slots [MaxPLAYERSLOTS]

::Replace [MaxPLAYERSLOTS] with any integer for however many people you want on your server at a time, more people, more lag. Especially considering all the extra content in this modpack.
